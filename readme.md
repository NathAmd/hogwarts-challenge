## Code Overview

The project is structured as a standard Express.js application. The entry point of the application is the `index.js` file. It sets up the Express.js server, connects to the MongoDB database using Mongoose, and includes the routes defined in `userRoutes.js`.

The `userRoutes.js` file defines the routes for user registration, login, and message handling. It uses Mongoose to interact with the MongoDB database and bcrypt to hash user passwords. It also uses express-brute for brute force protection.
